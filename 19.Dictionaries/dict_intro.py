# Definition - Ordered collection of items

# Key-value pairs
# Values can be any data type and can repeat
# Keys must be immutable and unique
# dict() for creating
# a = dict(name="Gosho", age=15)
# print(a)
# 6.6 times faster than lists
# Different architecture than lists - Hash tables - Keys -> Hash code
# Mutable objects - Key's value could be updated
