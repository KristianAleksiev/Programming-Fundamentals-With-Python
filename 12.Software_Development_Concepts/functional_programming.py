## Functional programming - Programming by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data and side-effects
# Declarative programming approach (not imperative)
# program state flows through pure functions

## Pure function - function which returns value only determined by its input -
# sqrt(5) == 25 always
# Takes a parameter and gives back a result based on the parameter

# Higher-order functions - Take other functions as arguments
