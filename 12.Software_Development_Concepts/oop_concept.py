### Concept of using classes and objects (class instances) to model the real world

##Inheritance - allows classes to inherit data and functionality from a parent class(base class)

# Interface -  defines abstract ACTIONS - Actions to be implemented in descendant classes -
# The class in question is something abstract for everyone, with specific functions - "Moving"
# The most abstract


# Abstract class - abstraction - Defines data + actions + abstract actions - e.g. Figure
#Not completely defined -  "Animal"


# Concrete class - SPECIFIC - Define data + concrete functionality - Qsno definirani svoistva

#With inheritance we can achieve the previous types classes
