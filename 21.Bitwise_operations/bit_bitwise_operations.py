# Bits, Numerals systems and bitwise operations

# What is Bit, Byte, KB, MB?
# - Bit - The smallest unit of data used in computing - Takes two values - 0 or 1 ( Two states )
# - Byte - A sequence of 8 bits, organized in computer memory, the smallest addressable unit
# - KiloByte - 1024 bytes ( sometimes 1000 bytes - marketing )
# - MegaByte - 1024 kb


# Numerals systems - Representing the sequence of digits
# - Decimal - Represented using 10 digits, base 10
# - Binary - 0 and 1 - 5 == 101b - base 2
# - Hexadecimal - Conversion to binary - 0-9, A-E
# Conversion between numeral systems


# Representation of Data in computer memory
# - Representing integers - sequence of bits - starts with 0(+), with 1 (-)
# - Real numbers - IEEE 754 Standard, exponent, mantissa
# - Text - ASCII table, unsigned integers


# Bitwise operators - bit by bit calculations - Competitive programming, code efficiency
# - ~ Turns all 0 to 1 and all 1 to 0 ( 101- 010)
# - |, & and ^
